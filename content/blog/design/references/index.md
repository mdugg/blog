title: First (lazy) blog post ...it's theived from Gatsby boilerplate

description: "Notes for myself, bunch of Markdown references"
---

I've decided to take [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for a spin :D

I started building this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but dumped it and switched to Gatsby.
As much as Jekyll 'felt' great, very intuitive for me - a designer, not developer - Gatsby uses a bunch of technologies that I'm more interested in delving into.

Gatsby is a steeper hill to climb, but rolling up the sleeves and delving in will pay greater dividends, I feel.

I'm keeping this Gatsby page as a lazy reference for Markdown. Really I should park this elsewhere, but it will be handy to quickly access within my VS Code project pane.

## ...so, turn back now! the rest of this is not worth reading
## ...also, this is just an example of a H2 using markdown
### ...you're still reading this, so here's an example of a H3 using markdown

> Here's a bunch of text that will be wrapped in \<blockquote> with markup escaped

Example of an image link: pic I took somewhere in Chattahoochee National Forest:
![Amazing mountains of Blue Ridge](./chattahoochee.jpg)

## Code blocks

```js
const saltyDuckEgg = "chinese preserved food product"
```
